# Maddy Perez - Discord Bot

<h1>Why did I create this discord bot?</h1>
The reason I created this bot, was so a friend could use gifs on her discord server! She was upset because she wanted a character from a show to display gifs from said show and the characters. With that in mind, I looked up some tutorials, mashed code together, and the bot was created!


<h1>Can I invite the bot to my server?</h1>
Sure, just invite the bot using the link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=503219487106138114&scope=bot


<h1>Did I code the bot yourself?</h1>
No, as I followed a very good tutorial, and the code is extremely similar to the original, as I was having many problems with other tutorials. I pretty much copied the code from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P1rB2MY4ZA It explains really well how to create a gif bot and it just works perfectly!

<h1>Do I intend on making any money with this bot?</h1>
No, I'm not accepting any kind of donations or payment, as the original code is not mine, and this was really just for a friend. I'm only doing this, to archive the code, in case I need it in the future.

Here's the bot in action. I made a GIF, in case you wanted to check it before using it!
